/**
 * Class used to implement performant, good-quality and intelligent image
 * scaling algorithms in native Java 2D. This class utilizes the Java2D
 * "best practices" for image-scaling, ensuring that images are hardware
 * accelerated at all times if provided by the platform and host-VM.
 * <p/>
 * Hardware acceleration also includes execution of optional caller-supplied
 * {@link BufferedImageOp}s that are applied to the resultant images before
 * returning them as well as any optional rotations specified.
 * <h3>Image Proportions</h3>
 * All scaling operations implemented by this class maintain the proportion of
 * the original image. If image-cropping is desired the caller will need to
 * perform those edits before calling one of the <code>resize</code> methods
 * provided by this class.
 * <p/>
 * In order to maintain the proportionality of the original images, this class
 * implements the following behavior:
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the image is LANDSCAPE-oriented or SQUARE, treat the
 * <code>targetWidth</code> as the primary dimension and re-calculate the
 * <code>targetHeight</code> regardless of what is passed in.</li>
 * <li>If image is PORTRAIT-oriented, treat the <code>targetHeight</code> as the
 * primary dimension and re-calculate the <code>targetWidth</code> regardless of
 * what is passed in.</li>
 * <li>If a {@link Mode} value of {@link Mode#FIT_TO_WIDTH} or
 * {@link Mode#FIT_TO_HEIGHT} is passed in to the <code>resize</code> method,
 * the image's orientation is ignored and the scaled image is fit to the
 * dimension the user specified with the {@link Mode}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Recalculation of the secondary dimensions is extremely cheap and this
 * approach provides users with better expected-behavior from the library.
 * <h3>Image Quality</h3>
 * This class implements a few different methods for scaling an image, providing
 * either the best-looking result, the fastest result or a balanced result
 * between the two depending on the scaling hint provided (see {@link Method}).
 * <p/>
 * This class also implements the incremental scaling algorithm presented by
 * Chris Campbell in his <a href="http://today.java
 * .net/pub/a/today/2007/04/03/perils-of-image-getscaledinstance.html">Perils of
 * Image.getScaledInstance()</a> article in order to give the best-looking
 * results to images scaled down below roughly 800px in size where using a
 * single scaling operation (even with
 * {@link RenderingHints#VALUE_INTERPOLATION_BICUBIC} interpolation) would
 * produce a much worse-looking result.
 * <p/>
 * Only when scaling using the {@link Method#AUTOMATIC} method will this class
 * look at the size of the image before selecting an approach to scaling the
 * image. If {@link Method#QUALITY} is specified, the best-looking algorithm
 * possible is always used.
 * <p/>
 * Minor modifications are made to Campbell's original implementation in the
 * form of:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instead of accepting a user-supplied interpolation method,
 * {@link RenderingHints#VALUE_INTERPOLATION_BICUBIC} interpolation is always
 * used. This was done after A/B comparison testing with large images
 * down-scaled to thumbnail sizes showed noticeable "blurring" when BILINEAR
 * interpolation was used. Given that Campbell's algorithm is only used in
 * QUALITY mode when down-scaling, it was determined that the user's expectation
 * of a much less blurry picture would require that BICUBIC be the default
 * interpolation in order to meet the QUALITY expectation.</li>
 * <li>After each iteration of the do-while loop that incrementally scales the
 * source image down, an explicit effort is made to call
 * {@link BufferedImage#flush()} on the interim temporary {@link BufferedImage}
 * instances created by the algorithm in an attempt to ensure a more complete GC
 * cycle by the VM when cleaning up the temporary instances (this is in addition
 * to disposing of the temporary {@link Graphics2D} references as well).</li>
 * <li>Extensive comments have been added to increase readability of the code.</li>
 * <li>Variable names have been expanded to increase readability of the code.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>NOTE</strong>: This class does not call {@link BufferedImage#flush()}
 * on any of the <em>source images</em> passed in by calling code; it is up to
 * the original caller to dispose of their source images when they are no longer
 * needed so the VM can most efficiently GC them.
 * <h3>Generated Image Types</h3>
 * Java2D provides support for a number of different image types defined as
 * <code>BufferedImage.TYPE_*</code> variables, unfortunately not all image
 * types are supported equally in Java2D. Some more obscure image types either
 * have poor or no support, leading to severely degraded quality when an attempt
 * is made by imgscalr to create a scaled instance <em>of the same type</em> as
 * the source image.
 * <p/>
 * To avoid imgscalr generating significantly worse-looking results than
 * alternative scaling approaches (e.g.
 * {@link Image#getScaledInstance(int, int, int)}), all resultant images
 * generated by imgscalr are one of two types:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link BufferedImage#TYPE_INT_RGB}</li>
 * <li>{@link BufferedImage#TYPE_INT_ARGB}</li>
 * </ol>
 * depending on if the source image utilizes transparency or not.
 * <p/>
 * This is a recommended approach by the Java2D team for dealing with poorly (or
 * non) supported image types. More can be read about this issue <a href=
 * "http://www.mail-archive.com/java2d-interest@capra.eng.sun.com/msg05621.html"
 * >here</a>.
 * <h3>Logging</h3>
 * This class implements all its debug logging via the
 * {@link #log(String, Object...)} method. At this time logging is done directly
 * to <code>System.out</code> via the <code>printf</code> method. This allows
 * the logging to be light weight and easy to capture while adding no
 * dependencies to the library.
 * <p/>
 * Implementation of logging in this class is as efficient as possible; avoiding
 * any calls to the logger or passing of arguments if logging is not enabled to
 * avoid the (hidden) cost of constructing the Object[] argument for the varargs
 * method call.
 * <h3>GIF Transparency</h3>
 * Unfortunately in Java 6 and earlier, support for GIF's
 * {@link IndexColorModel} is sub-par, both in accurate color-selection and in
 * maintaining transparency when moving to an image of type
 * {@link BufferedImage#TYPE_INT_ARGB}; because of this issue when a GIF image
 * is processed by imgscalr and the result saved as a GIF file, it is possible
 * to lose the alpha channel of a transparent image or in the case of applying
 * an optional {@link BufferedImageOp}, lose the entire picture all together in
 * the result (long standing JDK bugs are filed for these).
 * <p/>
 * imgscalr currently does nothing to work around this manually because it is a
 * defect in the native platform code itself. Fortunately it looks like the
 * issues are half-fixed in Java 7 and any manual workarounds we could attempt
 * internally are relatively expensive, in the form of hand-creating and setting
 * RGB values pixel-by-pixel with a custom {@link ColorModel} in the scaled
 * image. This would lead to a very measurable negative impact on performance
 * without the caller understanding why.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Workaround</strong>: A workaround to this issue with all version of
 * Java is to simply save a GIF as a PNG; no change to your code needs to be
 * made except when the image is saved out, e.g. using {@link ImageIO}. When a
 * file type of "PNG" is used, both the transparency and high color quality will
 * be maintained as the PNG code path in Java2D is superior to the GIF
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * If the issue with optional {@link BufferedImageOp}s destroying GIF image
 * content is ever fixed in the platform, saving out resulting images as GIFs
 * should suddenly start working.
 * <p>
 * More can be read about the issue <a
 * href="http://gman.eichberger.de/2007/07/transparent-gifs-in-java.html"
 * >here</a> and <a

	 * A {@link ConvolveOp} using a very light "blur" kernel that acts like an
	 * anti-aliasing filter (softens the image a bit) when applied to an image.
	 * <p/>
	 * A common request by users of the library was that they wished to "soften"
	 * resulting images when scaling them down drastically. After quite a bit of
	 * A/B testing, the kernel used by this Op was selected as the closest match
	 * for the target which was the softer results from the deprecated
	 * {@link AreaAveragingScaleFilter} (which is used internally by the
	 * deprecated {@link Image#getScaledInstance(int, int, int)} method in the
	 * JDK that imgscalr is meant to replace).
	 * <p/>
	 * This ConvolveOp uses a 3x3 kernel with the values:
	 * <table cellpadding="4" border="1">
	 * <tr>
	 * <td>.0f</td>
	 * <td>.08f</td>
	 * <td>.0f</td>
	 * </tr>
	 * <tr>
	 * <td>.08f</td>
	 * <td>.68f</td>
	 * <td>.08f</td>
	 * </tr>
	 * <tr>
	 * <td>.0f</td>
	 * <td>.08f</td>
	 * <td>.0f</td>
	 * </tr>
	 * </table>
	 * <p/>
	 * For those that have worked with ConvolveOps before, this Op uses the
	 * {@link ConvolveOp#EDGE_NO_OP} instruction to not process the pixels along
	 * the very edge of the image (otherwise EDGE_ZERO_FILL would create a
	 * black-border around the image). If you have not worked with a ConvolveOp
	 * before, it just means this default OP will "do the right thing" and not
	 * give you garbage results.
	 * <p/>
	 * This ConvolveOp uses no {@link RenderingHints} values as internally the
	 * {@link ConvolveOp} class only uses hints when doing a color conversion
	 * between the source and destination {@link BufferedImage} targets.
	 * imgscalr allows the {@link ConvolveOp} to create its own destination
	 * image every time, so no color conversion is ever needed and thus no
	 * hints.
	 * <h3>Performance</h3>
	 * Use of this (and other) {@link ConvolveOp}s are hardware accelerated when
	 * possible. For more information on if your image op is hardware
	 * accelerated or not, check the source code of the underlying JDK class
	 * that actually executes the Op code, <a href=
	 * "http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/awt/image/ImagingLib.java.html"
	 * >sun.awt.image.ImagingLib</a>.
	 * <h3>Known Issues</h3>
	 * In all versions of Java (tested up to Java 7 preview Build 131), running
	 * this op against a GIF with transparency and attempting to save the
	 * resulting image as a GIF results in a corrupted/empty file. The file must
	 * be saved out as a PNG to maintain the transparency.
